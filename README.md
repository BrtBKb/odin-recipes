# odin-recipes
A quick html and css project of my favorite recipes.

Today, I will be building a basic website using html. 
The content of the website will be about a few of my favorite recipes.

I have learn that hyper-text markup language is used to write the structure of the website. 
One of my favorite feature is how it uses elements to organize the data of the website.
By the end of this project, I will have demostrated basic html elements such as lists, title, img and link other files together.
